# StudySync AI Assistant Guide

StudySync includes an AI assistant that specializes in STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This guide explains how to use the AI assistant effectively in your study rooms.

## How to Use the AI Assistant

In any study room, you can interact with the AI assistant by using the following commands:

- Type `/ai` followed by your question
- Type `@ai` followed by your question

For example:
```
/ai Explain the concept of photosynthesis
```

or

```
@ai What is the derivative of f(x) = x³ + 2x² - 4x + 7?
```

## STEM Subject Specializations

The AI assistant is optimized for STEM subjects and can help with:

### Mathematics

The AI can help with various math topics including:
- Algebra
- Calculus
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Statistics
- Number theory

**Example questions:**
- `/ai Solve the quadratic equation: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0`
- `/ai What is the integral of sin(x)?`
- `/ai Explain the Pythagorean theorem`

### Science

The AI can assist with science topics including:
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Astronomy
- Earth science

**Example questions:**
- `/ai Explain Newton's laws of motion`
- `/ai How does the Krebs cycle work?`
- `/ai What is the difference between ionic and covalent bonds?`

### Programming & Computer Science

The AI can help with programming and computer science topics:
- Algorithm explanations
- Code examples in various languages
- Data structures
- Computer science concepts

**Example questions:**
- `/ai Write a function to find the Fibonacci sequence in JavaScript`
- `/ai Explain the difference between a stack and a queue`
- `/ai How does binary search work?`

## Tips for Getting the Best Responses

1. **Be specific** - Clearly state what you're asking about
2. **One question at a time** - Ask multiple questions separately for better responses
3. **Provide context** - For complex problems, include relevant information
4. **Specify the format** - If you need a specific format (e.g., step-by-step solution), mention it

## Examples of Effective Questions

### ✅ Good Questions:

- `/ai Explain the concept of gravitational potential energy and provide the formula`
- `/ai Solve step-by-step: If f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 5, find f'(x)`
- `/ai Write a Python function that checks if a string is a palindrome`

### ❌ Less Effective Questions:

- `/ai help me with math` (too vague)
- `/ai explain everything about chemistry` (too broad)
- `/ai do my homework` (not specific enough)

## Limitations

- The AI assistant provides educational guidance but may not always be 100% accurate
- For complex or specialized topics, always verify information with textbooks or instructors
- The AI works best with clear, focused questions rather than very broad topics
